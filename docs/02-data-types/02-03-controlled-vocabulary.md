## Controlled Vocabulary
We define a *Controlled Vocabulary* as a collection of unique terms from the same context such, that each term contains a name, description, and if necessary, more attributes.
DeepBlue has 5 different controlled vocabularies, one for each of the following contexts:
 * Genomes
 * Epigenetic Marks
 * BioSources
 * Techniques
 * Projects

These controlled vocabularies are used for describing [Experiments](02-01-experiments.md) and the genomes controlled vocabulary is used by the [Annotations](02-02-annotations.md).
