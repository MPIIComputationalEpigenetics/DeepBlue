# Working with Sequences

In the [genomes](../02-data-types/02-04-genomes.md) section we showed how to [insert DNA Sequences](http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/api.php#api-upload_chromosome) into DeepBlue.
DeepBlue offers two means of dealing with sequences:
 * [obtaining the regions' sequences](06-01-obtaining-region-sequences.md)
 * [finding and counting patterns](06-02-patterns.md)

Please remember that it is necessary to use the [upload_chromosome](http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/api.php#api-upload_chromosome) command before the sequences content can be accessed. DeepBlue already has the sequences for the genome assembly *hg19*.
