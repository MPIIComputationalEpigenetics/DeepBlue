## Creating User Account

It is not necessary to have a user account to use the DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server.
The easiest way for using DeepBlue is though the user key ```anonymous_key```.
You can use the user key ```anonymous_key``` for listing and accessing the public data stored into DeepBlue.

It is recommended to request an account if you use DeepBlue frequently.
A DeepBlue account gives the following benefits:

* Store and access private data.
* Listing and caching yours previous requests.

The process for creating a user account is simple: access the page for [requesting account](http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/register.php) and fill the required fields.
After we process your request, you will receive an email containing a *user_key*.
Because these requests are individually processed, do not expect a prompt reply.
Keep the *user_key* safe, and do not share it with anyone.
It is your unique and personal identification for the DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server.
